This problem is closely related to the one in the folder one level up "ConnectivityTowardsMultiEmbed". As everything under a multi-embed can now have multiple different docker locations, and we have no idea how to distinguish between them without any help from the developer. So once again we will use the "[Service 1 | Service 2]:5000" filler. But once again, in practice this wouldn't be a real program, as the OP could be connected to either of the services under multi-embeds as there are multiple versions of the same service.
