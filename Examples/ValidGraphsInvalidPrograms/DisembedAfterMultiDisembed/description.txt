This problem is closely related to the one in the folder one level up "ConnectivityTowardsMultiEmbed". When we are embedding e.g., in this case Service2 twice, that embeds another service S4 with a non-local ip the program tries to deploy two services on the same ip and throws an error.

The only way we can try to resolve this are by e.g., slicing Service3 -> Service2 or Service1 -> Service2. This way Service 4 will be deployed on another location because of docker.
